# UIToolbox

A personal toolbox for UIKit to accelarate iOS development :rocket:

This Swift package is designed to make iOS app development with UIKit faster by providing a
suite of utilities to perform common functions such as settings constraints and creating stack
views with predefined settings.

UIToolbox also includes some custom classes:

- **UIBadgeImageView** is a custom image view that includes a child badge that renders a system
symbol from SF Symbols.

## Getting started

UIToolbox can be added to any Xcode project through the Swift Package Manager in Xcode, or it
can be built from source and added externally.

### Building from source

To build UIToolbox, you will need the following tools:
- Xcode 12 or later
- Swift 5.6 or later (bundled with Xcode 13 and/or macOS 12 SDKs)

Clone the repository from GitHub using `git clone` or `gh repo clone`, and then open the
project in Xcode to build normally. Alternatively, run the `swift build` command inside of the
root directory of the repository to build it.

## Licensing

This package is currently under a proprietary license until further notice.
